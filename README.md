/*Game Rules:

Objective: 
Be the first to sink all of your opponent's ships.

Contents: 
3 ships each (6 total), 
1 opponent board (hits - red, misses - gray, hidden ships - no color), 
1 player board (blue - ships, hits - red, misses - gray)

Rules:
1. Each player places their ships on the board horizontally or vertically
(this position cannot be changed once placed). <Add Figure with Example>
< Stretch - Start with randomly generated ships, but later add ability to select ship, 
and then select position using an arrow. >
2. First player selects a spot on the opponent's board. If the shot is a hit,
the spot will turn red. If it is a miss, the spot will turn gray.
< Stretch - hits yellow until full ship is sunk, then turns red. >
< Stretch - indicate which ship was hit, and change that ship in the DOM. >
3. After the player goes, the computer takes a turn. 
< Stretch - computer will act strategically instead of selecting a random open spot. >
